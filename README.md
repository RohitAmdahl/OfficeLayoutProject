Office Layout Management System
This project is built using .NET C# and models an office building, representing its various rooms and their associated furniture and equipment. The aim is to manage the objects and interactions within the office environment programmatically.

##Project Overview
The "Office Layout Management System" is a C# application that represents an office building, defining its rooms and the objects within those rooms (e.g., furniture, electronics). This can be useful for office management, interior planning, and potentially as part of a larger building or management simulation application.

##Office Layout
The office is modeled with the following rooms:

Conference Room:
Furniture: 1 long table, 12 chairs.
Equipment: Big light for meetings.

Employee Office Room:
Furniture: 1 office table, 1 office chair.
Equipment: 1 TV screen, 1 computer, lamps.

Boss Room:
Furniture: 1 office table, 1 office chair (for the boss).
Additional Seats: 2 visitor seats, 1 sofa.
Equipment: 1 TV, lamps for ambient lighting.

Kitchen:
Furniture: 1 kitchen bench.
Appliances: Kettle, microwave, fridge, coffee machine.
Reception:

Furniture: 1 reception table, 1 reception chair.
Floor Plan
The office layout is depicted with four main rooms:

Conference Room
Kitchen
Room 1 (Employee Office)
Room 2 (Boss Room)
Reception Area
Future Enhancements
Potential future expansions of the project may include:

Interactions between office objects and users.
Management of different office resources and their statuses.
User interface for real-time office monitoring.
Integration of a backend system to manage employee activities.
